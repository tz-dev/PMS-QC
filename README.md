# PMS-QC — Praxeological Meta-Structure for Quantum Computing

**PMS-QC** is an exploratory research project applying the **Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)** theory as a *structural and contextual layer* for quantum computing.  
It investigates how PMS’s operator algebra (Δ–Ψ), frame semantics (□), asymmetry (Ω), isolation (Χ), and integration (Σ) can be mapped onto quantum computational paradigms such as:

- quantum circuits  
- basis/context switching  
- superposition & entanglement boundaries  
- quantum measurement  
- hybrid classical–quantum workflows  

This repository contains the initial conceptual analysis in multiple formats (HTML, Markdown, PDF), along with minimal CSS styling.

## 📜 Overview

### ★ What is PMS-QC?
PMS-QC explores **how a unified operator-algebraic system model (PMS)** can serve as:

- a **conceptual OS/VM layer** for quantum computation  
- an **intermediate semantic model** bridging classical and quantum execution  
- a **frame-based context calculus** compatible with quantum state spaces  
- a **policy-aware, structurally constrained** reasoning layer for hybrid systems  

The PMS theory provides:

- a compact operator set  
  `O = {Δ, ∇, □, Λ, Α, Ω, Θ, Φ, Χ, Σ, Ψ}`
- a monoidal composition structure  
- a hierarchical frame/context model  
- a formal system for distinction, transformation, asymmetry, temporality, isolation, and integration  

The PMS-QC paper demonstrates how these primitives naturally map to quantum mechanics.

## 🔮 Why PMS for Quantum Computing?

Quantum computation is inherently:

- contextual  
- operator-driven  
- basis-dependent  
- non-local  
- relational  
- superpositional  

The PMS operator set encodes **exactly** these kinds of transformations.

This project highlights the deep structural alignment between PMS and quantum computation:

| PMS Operator | Quantum Interpretation |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Δ (Distinction) | State initialization / subspace separation |
| Φ (Reframe) | Basis transform / unitary |
| Θ (Temporality) | Circuit depth / scheduling layer |
| Σ (Integration) | Measurement / collapse |
| Χ (Isolation) | Entanglement boundaries / subsystem isolation |
| Ω (Asymmetry) | Control flow, role assignment, qubit targeting |
| □ (Frame) | Quantum subsystem / register / Hilbert subspace |
| Α (Attractor) | Repeated patterns / template circuits |
